// In C++ int main(), for the example above is the main() function. anything inside "{ }" is considered as the properties of that function which defines scope of that function.
// If asked define scope then whatever inside "{ }" is considered as the properties/scope of that function.
// int main() is the starting point of our code

// return 0 - represents succesful execution of our code
// If it returns non zero number for example 12,89,etc then it represents unsuccessful execution

// Here <iostream> is a header file which consists of functionality related to inputs and outputs and standard library related.

// using namespace std; ----- defines the standard namespace. It consists of definition for identifiers such as "cout" and "endl".
// If we want to use "cout" we need to define the namespace library and its related functionality using iostream and namespace std.

// cout ------ is a identifier used to get/print output
// << --> We use this insertion operator with cout to print something

// "Hello, world!" --- Anythng inside " " is called string.

// endl-----is used to print on a new line

// ; --- is used for termination of that line
